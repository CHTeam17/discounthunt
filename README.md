How to Build and Test
---------------------

Use `mvn clean install` to build the service and run the tests.


FAQ / Troubleshooting
---------------------

If you get failed tests while building with `mvn clean install`, e.g. *"response code expected:201 but was:500"*, 
then it probably means that the test cannot connect to the core services due to your proxy settings.

Hint: In that case, you might want to try it out with:

    mvn clean install -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.wdf.sap.corp -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.wdf.sap.corp
